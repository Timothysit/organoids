# The organoid project 

This repository contains the code used for the analysis in the paper: 

(insert paper link) 

This includes: 

1. Signal filtering 
2. Spike detection 
3. Correlation analysis 
4. And their visualisations 

(Note that supplementary materials here are not peer-reviewed)

All analysis were performed using `MATLAB`, and the main scripts used for analysis are `ogranoidProject.m` for spike detection, and `organoidCorrelation` for analysis of functional connectivity.
