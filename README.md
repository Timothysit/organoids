# The organoid project 

This repository contains the code used for the analysis in the paper: 

(insert paper link) 

This includes: 

1. Signal filtering 
2. Spike detection 
3. Correlation analysis 
4. And their visualisations 

(Note that supplementary materials here are not peer-reviewed)

All analysis were performed using `MATLAB`, and the main script used for analysis is `organoidCorrelation.m`. All functions used are within the folder `dependencies`, and should be added to path (along with its subfolders) in order to perform the analysis and visualisations.
