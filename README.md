# The organoid project 

This repository contains the code used for the microelectrode array (MEA) data analysis in the paper: 

[**Cerebral organoids at the air-liquid interface generate diverse nerve tracts with functional output**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0350-2)

This includes: 

1. Signal filtering 
2. Spike detection 
3. Correlation analysis 
4. And their visualisations 

(Note that supplementary materials here are not peer-reviewed)

All analysis were performed using `MATLAB`, and the main scripts used for analysis are `ogranoidProject.m` for spike detection, and `organoidCorrelation` for analysis of functional connectivity. 

Most visualisations were performed using `MATLAB`, with the exception of the network plot, which was made using the `R` interface for `igraph`. The code for this is available in the folder `R_analysis`. Placement of scale bars and legends for some plots were adjusted in Adobe Illustrator.
